## 🛠️ Built With Kiro

This project was developed using Kiro's advanced AI-powered development tools:

### Spec-to-Code Development
- Created detailed specifications in `.kiro/specs/interactive-features.md`
- Used Kiro to implement the complete JavaScript functionality based on the spec
- Iterative development process with clear requirements and success criteria

### Agent Hooks Automation
- **Auto-Format Hook**: Automatically formats CSS and HTML files on save
- **Test Runner Hook**: Manual testing for accessibility and performance validation
- Hooks improved development workflow by automating repetitive tasks

### Steering for Code Quality
- Established project standards in `.kiro/steering/project-standards.md`
- Ensured consistent code quality, accessibility compliance, and performance optimization
- Guided development decisions throughout the project lifecycle

## 🎯 How Kiro Enhanced Development

### Conversation Structure
1. **Initial Setup**: Discussed hackathon requirements and project vision
2. **Architecture Planning**: Structured the application with modular JavaScript classes
3. **Feature Implementation**: Used specs to guide systematic feature development
4. **Quality Assurance**: Applied steering rules for consistent code standards

### Most Impressive Code Generation
Kiro generated the complete `FocusZen` JavaScript class with:
- Complex timer logic with state management
- Local storage integration for data persistence
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for interactive features
- Event handling for user interactions
- Notification system with audio feedback

The generated code was production-ready with proper error handling, accessibility features, and performance optimizations.
